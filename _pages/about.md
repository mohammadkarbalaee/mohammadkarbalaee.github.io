I am a **Computer Science** graduate and a current Master's student in **Artificial Intelligence**, equipped with a solid foundation in software engineering. With over four years of hands-on experience in **mobile** and **web development**, I have successfully contributed to a wide range of projects, from building scalable applications to optimizing real-world systems for better performance and efficiency. 

Beyond development, I have a deep passion for **research**, particularly where **AI** intersects with **software engineering**. I am driven by the goal of advancing the field by publishing impactful research papers and contributing to the development of **open-source** projects that challenge the limits of modern technology. My aspiration is to leverage my technical expertise and research capabilities to shape the future of AI and software development.

## Academia  
I earned my Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science** from [**Shahid Beheshti University**](https://en.sbu.ac.ir/), where I cultivated a strong academic background in algorithms, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. Currently, I am advancing my knowledge and expertise through a Master's in **Artificial Intelligence** at [**Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU)**](https://www.fau.eu/), where I focus on AI-driven research and applications. My academic pursuits are aimed at becoming a proficient researcher, contributing meaningful knowledge to the field by publishing high-quality papers that push the boundaries of AI and software engineering.

My research interests are:

- Image Processing
- Computer Vision
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## Industry
