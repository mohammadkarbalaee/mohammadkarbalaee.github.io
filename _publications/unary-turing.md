title: "Unary to Decimal Converter Turing Machine"
collection: publications
category: preprint
permalink: /publication/unary-decimal-turing
excerpt: "This paper presents the design and implementation of a Turing Machine specifically created to convert unary numbers into decimal format. The primary objective of this work is to explore the theoretical underpinnings of this conversion process, using a Turing Machine to demonstrate how such transformations can be efficiently executed within a formal computational framework. The paper includes a detailed examination of the machine's components, including its state transitions, tape alphabet, and transition functions, providing a step-by-step breakdown of how the unary representation is processed and converted into the corresponding decimal value."
