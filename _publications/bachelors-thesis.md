excerpt: 'Traffic sign recognition (TSR) is a critical component in autonomous driving systems, directly impacting road safety and navigation efficiency. However, existing TSR models often struggle under adverse conditions such as poor lighting, motion blur, and occlusions. This thesis proposes a robust traffic sign recognition system that integrates deep learning with collaborative perception in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) to enhance accuracy and reliability under challenging scenarios. A MobileNetV2-based model, fine-tuned on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, was employed for efficient and accurate sign detection. The system was further evaluated through simulated VANET environments, enabling vehicles to share recognition data and collectively validate traffic sign interpretations. Experimental results demonstrated that while the standalone model achieved high accuracy under normal conditions, the VANET-integrated system significantly outperformed it under distortions like motion blur and rotation, improving recognition accuracy by up to 15.51%. These findings highlight the potential of collaborative vehicular communication in mitigating recognition errors and enhancing autonomous driving safety. Future research directions include optimizing communication protocols and incorporating advanced machine learning techniques for broader real-world applications.'
