excerpt: "This presentation provided an in-depth Introduction to Digital Cash, exploring the fundamental concepts behind digital currencies and their evolution. The focus was on two renowned digital cash systems: David Chaum's eCash and Stefan Brands' digital cash model. The session examined the key features of these systems, their cryptographic foundations, and how they contribute to the development of privacy and security in digital transactions.

David Chaum's eCash introduced revolutionary concepts such as blind signatures to ensure privacy in electronic transactions, paving the way for secure digital payment methods. Stefan Brands' system further built on these ideas by offering anonymous digital cash with enhanced security features, including improved methods for authentication and privacy preservation.

This presentation was delivered as part of the Cryptography course at Shahid Beheshti University, where students gained insights into the history and technical aspects of digital currencies, exploring how cryptography underpins the security of modern digital cash systems."
