excerpt: 'Streaming platforms have revolutionized entertainment, offering convenience and vast content libraries. Among the most popular services, Disney+ is often viewed as a family-friendly platform, while Netflix is known for its diverse content, spanning genres from comedies to mature dramas. Despite their reputations, both platforms cater to broader audiences. Disney+ features franchises like Marvel and Star Wars, which appeal beyond children, while Netflix includes family-friendly titles. This raises two critical questions: • Does Disney+ predominantly feature content with lower age restrictions? • Are Netflix movies generally of higher quality, based on Rotten Tomatoes scores?'
